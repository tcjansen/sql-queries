# sql-queries

This is a repo for my SQL queries.

It includes a python script I wrote to generate queries for the IDs of stars observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite that have the same characteristics of a given list of other stars (agreeing within 2sig). The reference table did not have the same column names as the database, which is why I wrote an external script instead of just doing it all in SQL.
